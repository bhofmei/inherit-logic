2018-04-16\n\nfixed issue with potential incorrect error dropping bact tube to plate directly\nUPDATED plexer submission\nwhen submit button is pushed, a spinner appears in the top left of the results table and the submit button is disabled\nspinner is hidden and button is active once the results come back from the server\nthis will hopefully minimize students sending the same plexer request several times bc they weren't sure if it went through--this causes server overload\n\n\n\n[v1.0.8] - 2018-02-26\n\nSave parent id of phage from plate to fridge\nGet parent info about phage when getting fridge\nDisplay phage parent strain number in dialog\n\n[v1.0.7] - 2018-02-23\n\nUPDATED the way phage mutations are stored to save memory\nupdated all genetics components\nupdated model\nupdated front end interface and pipe\n\n\nUPDATED on rest bacteria, only WT-like genotypes sent to client so smaller data transfer\nREMOVED rate limiting (causing server errors)\nFIXED over capacity for plexer\nADDED \"Page not found\" component for invalid URL\nADDED shuffle plaque lists to force mutants and recombinants to the front\nWhen small/large plaques 100-400\nHandle and shuffle each separately\n\n\n\n[v1.0.6] - 2018-02-20\n\nFIXED recombination error which was under-generating recombinants\nADDED ability to delete non-admin users\nADDED ability to delete course\nREMOVED revoke access option on user fridges\n\n[v1.0.5]\n\nADDED rate limiting\ngenetics routes\nuser auth/update routes\n\n\nUPDATED backend genetics testing\n\n[v1.0.4] - 2018-01-24\n\nADDED Ability to reset password\nsends email to user if user exists\npassword reset token expires after an hour\n\n\nADDED SSL support\nFIXED bugs\ngrant scenario access\nSign out blocking issue\n\n\n\n[v1.0.3] - 2018-01-23\n\nADDED User profile and update password pages\nADDED user controller tests\n\n[v1.0.2] - 2018-01-10\n\nFIXED issues with genetics logic\noverflow on REST bact\nnum phage generated with
